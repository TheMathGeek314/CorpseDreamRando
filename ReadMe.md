# CorpseDreamRando

This Hollow Knight Randomizer connection adds 64 new locations and lore items, obtained by dream nailing the various corpses scattered around the map.

This is not all objects with dream nail dialogue, and this does not cover some of the more important points of interest. 
Many of those locations are covered by LoreRandomizer. CorpseDreamRando only focuses on the random unimportant background corpses.

Two of these locations do overlap with LoreRando, so depending on which connections are enabled, Basin_Key and Lighthouse locations may be removed to avoid overlap.
